# boxwood_blight_epi

Scripts associated with experiments tracking boxwood blight disease (caused by <em>Calonectria henricotiae</em> and <em>C. pseudonaviculata</em>) development and spread on different cultivars of boxwood planted at a field site in Low Gap, NC. 

* Experiment 1 ('Expt_1')
  * This experiment tracks disease progress on 21 different boxwood cultivars with varying levels of susceptibility to boxwood blight infection. The Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) was calculated for each cultivar to perform further statistical analyses.

* Experiment 2 ('Expt_2')
  * This is a new experiment that is being developed to track and visualize the spread of boxwood blight disease between boxwood cultivars to understand how the observed disease severity and relative susceptiblity of neighboring plants influences the observed disease severity of a plant of interest.
