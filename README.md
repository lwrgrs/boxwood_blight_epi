# boxwood_blight_epi

Scripts associated with experiments tracking boxwood blight disease (caused by <em>Calonectria henricotiae</em> and <em>C. pseudonaviculata</em>) development and spread on different cultivars of boxwood planted at a field site in Low Gap, NC. 

* Experiment 1 ('Expt_1')
  * This experiment tracks disease progress on 21 different boxwood cultivars with varying levels of susceptibility to boxwood blight infection. We calculated the Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) for each cultivar to perform further statistical analyses.

* Experiment 2 ('Expt_2')
  * This is a new experiment that we are developing to track and visualize the spread of boxwood blight disease between boxwood cultivars with varying levels of susceptibilty to boxwood blight infection.
